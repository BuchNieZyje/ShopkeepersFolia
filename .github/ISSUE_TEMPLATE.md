## Before reporting

* Check if your question is already answered in the [documentation](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers-Wiki/wiki) or, especially, the [FAQ](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers-Wiki/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).
* Check if there is already [another ticket](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers/issues) for your issue, for which you can provide additional information instead, or which already provides information about possible workarounds.
* Try if you can reproduce your issue when using a freshly setup server using the latest version of Spigot, Shopkeepers (with default configuration), and no other plugins. This can already give insights on whether your server version or another plugin is involved in the issue.

## When reporting

* Please provide the versions you are using of both Craftbukkit/Spigot and Shopkeepers.
* Thoroughly describe the problem you are having, including step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the problem.
* Provide as much information as possible, which could help reproducing the issue on a freshly setup server.
